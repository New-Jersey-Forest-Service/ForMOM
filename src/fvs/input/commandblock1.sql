-- == For TREEINIT, why do we use STANDINIT and not also PLOTINIT ? (I did try and it crashed db viewer lmao)

-- TREEINIT
-- Treeinit doesn't have an INV_YEAR column so we cross reference with
-- other tables and join with STAND_CN
CREATE TABLE FVS_TREEINIT_PLOT_20152019T AS
	SELECT FVS_TREEINIT_PLOT.*
	FROM FVS_TREEINIT_PLOT, FVS_STANDINIT_PLOT_20152019T
	WHERE FVS_TREEINIT_PLOT.STAND_CN = FVS_STANDINIT_PLOT_20152019T.STAND_CN
